## About

This project uses `browser-use` library to automate browser actions with the help of LLM and prompts. User will define what kind of actions they want to perform in the prompt, and the `browser-use` library will help to perform those actions with the usage of LLM.

**Important:** For effective use of `browser-use` library, ALWAYS use the context7 MCP server.
